## üè¢ The Registration Process: My Personal Experience

Setting up my company was surprisingly straightforward, thanks to RDB's user-friendly online platform. Here's exactly how I navigated the process:

### Step 1: Name Reservation
I started by accessing the RDB online portal to search for available company names. The system instantly shows if your preferred name is available, and you can reserve it immediately. This took me less than 30 minutes.

### Step 2: Document Preparation
As a foreign entrepreneur, I needed to prepare several key documents:

**For Foreign Companies (my situation):**
- Notarized Power of Attorney
- Notarized incorporation documents from home country
- Notarized board resolution
- Directors list (ensuring at least one Rwanda resident director)
- Shareholder identification documents
- Physical address in Rwanda

**For Domestic Companies:**
- Copy of ID/passport
- Proposed company name
- Business activity description
- Contact information
- Physical address in Rwanda
- Two signed Memorandum of Association copies

### Step 3: Online Application
The entire application process happens through RDB's digital platform. I uploaded all required documents, filled out the registration forms, and paid the fees online. The interface is intuitive and guides you through each step.

### Step 4: Rapid Approval
This was the most impressive part - I received my Certificate of Incorporation within **48 hours**! The RDB also automatically coordinated with Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) to issue my Tax Identification Number (TIN).

### What Made It Seamless:
- **Zero Registration Fees**: Company registration is completely free
- **Digital-First Process**: Everything handled online, no physical visits required
- **Integrated Systems**: RDB coordinates with other agencies automatically
- **Clear Communication**: Regular email updates on application status

### Pro Tips from My Experience:
1. **Get Local Legal Advice**: I consulted with local lawyers to ensure compliance
2. **Prepare Documents Early**: Have all notarized documents ready before starting
3. **Physical Address Requirement**: Secure a Rwanda address before applying
4. **Rwanda Resident Director**: Essential for foreign companies - consider local partnerships

The entire process from name reservation to receiving my incorporation certificate took only 3 days, including document preparation time. This efficiency was instrumental in accelerating our launch timeline and demonstrated Rwanda's genuine commitment to supporting entrepreneurs.
